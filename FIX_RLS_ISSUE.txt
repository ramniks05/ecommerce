========================================
FIX ROW LEVEL SECURITY (RLS) ISSUE
========================================

PROBLEM:
"new row violates row-level security policy for table brands"

This means Supabase RLS is blocking your admin operations.

========================================
QUICK FIX (2 MINUTES)
========================================

Step 1: Go to Supabase SQL Editor
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mqvxithtgyewckeabbsq/sql

Step 2: Click "New Query"

Step 3: Open file in your project:
disable-rls-for-testing.sql

Step 4: Copy ALL content from that file

Step 5: Paste into Supabase SQL Editor

Step 6: Click "Run" (or press Ctrl+Enter)

Step 7: Wait for "Success" message

========================================
WHAT THIS DOES
========================================

Disables RLS on all tables for testing:
‚úÖ brands - Can now add/edit/delete
‚úÖ products - Can now add/edit/delete
‚úÖ categories - Can now add/edit/delete
‚úÖ banners - Can now add/edit/delete
‚úÖ orders - Can now view/manage
‚úÖ users - Can now manage
‚úÖ All other tables - Full access

========================================
AFTER RUNNING THE SCRIPT
========================================

1. Go back to: http://localhost:5173/admin/brands

2. Click "Add Brand"

3. Fill form and upload logo

4. Click "Save"

5. SUCCESS! Brand created! ‚úÖ

========================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
========================================

‚ö†Ô∏è This disables security for TESTING ONLY!

For PRODUCTION, you should:
1. Re-enable RLS
2. Create proper policies
3. Restrict based on user roles

But for now, this lets you test and develop!

========================================
VERIFY IT WORKED
========================================

After running the script, check:

1. In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
   SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
   FROM pg_tables 
   WHERE schemaname = 'public';

2. You should see:
   brands        | f  ‚Üê f = false = disabled ‚úÖ
   products      | f  ‚Üê disabled ‚úÖ
   categories    | f  ‚Üê disabled ‚úÖ

========================================
NEXT STEPS
========================================

1. Run disable-rls-for-testing.sql
2. Test adding brand with image
3. Should work perfectly!
4. Later: Add proper RLS policies for production

========================================

Run the SQL script and your admin panel will work! üöÄ
